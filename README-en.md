# **Child Relationship Search Page**
If you use Workbench, you can check the child relations related to the parent object, but it was a little difficult to use, so I created it.🔨🔧  
Please use it if you like.💁‍♂️

## User object search
Since the number of child relations is large for the user object,  
 the "Omit Create By ID & Last Modified ID" checkbox✅ is provided as a search condition.
### 【Omit Create By ID & Last Modified ID　checkbox "false"】
